abstract
The chromatin regulator FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) is essential for ensuring stable gene expression by promoting transcription. In a genetic screen using Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified that FACT maintains cell identities and acts as a barrier for transcription factor-mediated cell fate reprogramming. Strikingly, FACTâ€™s role as a barrier to cell fate conversion is conserved in humans as we show that FACT depletion enhances reprogramming of fibroblasts. Such activity is unexpected because FACT is known as a positive regulator of gene expression, and previously described reprogramming barriers typically repress gene expression. While FACT depletion in human fibroblasts results in decreased expression of many genes, a number of FACT-occupied genes, including reprogramming-promoting factors, show increased expression upon FACT depletion, suggesting a repressive function of FACT. Our findings identify FACT as a cellular reprogramming barrier in C. elegans and humans, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for cell fate protection.

  Title 	Revealing regulatory transcription factors of aging in the kidney and kidney through multi-omics analysis
  
  Summary 	Aging is accompanied by a gradual loss of systemic metabolic homeostasis, which is maintained by multiple-organs, especially the kidney and kidney. However, a systematic study of the regulatory networks and regulatory transcription factors (TFs) of aging in the kidney and kidney remains lacking. Here, we performed an integrated analysis of multi-omics datasets in the kidney and kidney from young and aged mice, including RNA-seq, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and ATAC-seq datasets, which indicated that enhanced inflammation and dysregulated metabolism were conserved signatures in aged kidney and kidney in both the transcriptome and epigenome. Transcription factor and regulatory network analysis indicated that activation of AP-1 and SPI1 was responsible for enhanced inflammation, and down-regulation of HNFs and PPARs contributed to dysregulated metabolism in aged kidney and kidney. Importantly, we found that the activation of AP-1 was cellular autonomous in aged hepatic and renal cells. However, enhanced SPI1 was caused by elevated infiltration of macrophages. Importantly, inhibition of AP-1 with small molecule combination attenuated inflammation phenotypes of aging in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our analysis revealed common signatures and regulatory TFs of aging in the kidney and kidney, providing novel targets for the development of anti-aging interventions.

  Title 	Pioneer factor GAF cooperates with PBAP and NURF to regulate transcription [ATAC-seq]
  Organism 	Drosophila melanogaster
  Experiment type 	Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing
  Summary 	The Drosophila pioneer factor GAF is known to be essential for RNA Pol II promoter-proximal pausing and the removal of nucleosomes from a set of target promoters with GAGAG motifs. We and others have speculated that GAF recruits the ISWI family ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex NURF, on the basis that NURF and GAF are both required to remodel nucleosomes on an hsp70 promoter in vitro and that GAF interacts physically with NURF. However, GAF was also recently shown to interact with PBAP, a SWI/SNF family remodeler. To test which of these remodeling complexes GAF works with, we depleted GAF, NURF301, BAP170, and NURF301+BAP170 in Drosophila S2 cells using RNAi. We used a combination of PRO-seq, ATAC-seq, 3'RNA-seq, and CUT&RUN to demonstrate that while GAF and PBAP synergistically open chromatin at target promoters which allows Pol II recruitment and pausing to proceed, GAF and NURF also synergistically position the +1 nucleosome to ensure efficient pause release and transition to productive elongation.
    	
  Overall design 	We treated two independent replicates of Drosophila S2 cells with dsRNA to LACZ (control), GAF, NURF301, BAP170 (the unique subunits of the NURF and PBAP complexes, respectively), and NURF301+BAP170. After 5 days, we harvested cells, validated knockdowns, and performed PRO-seq, ATAC-seq and 3'RNA-seq. We also performed CUT&RUN for both GAF and NURF301 in untreated S2 cells.
